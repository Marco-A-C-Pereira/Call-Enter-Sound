# Enter Call Sound

A Integration Between Discord and Soundpad based on NodeJS. I don't like how discord handles it so I made it my own implementation of it.

## How it works

It uses Soundpad Windows Pipe and Discord gateway for listening to the user voice activity.

## How to run

Clone this repo and do a

```
 npm init
```

The config file will de available soon as the interface is implemented
